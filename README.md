# parking-garage

This project is my first attempt at learning Laravel. I'm focusing on growing out the functionality by overengineering as a way to challenge what it does and what areas of the Laravel functionality I get into.

All the fun stuff can be seen by running phpunit and watching the poorly-formatted output :)
